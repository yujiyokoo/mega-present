# bgcol sets the background colour
# Colours are specified as RGB in hexadecimal format.
# So FFF is white, 000 is black, and so on.

# img,x,y,image_name shows image at (x,y) position
# image_name is the variable name in res/resources.h (e.g. "mountains_bg" of "extern const Image mountains_bg;")
# image files are located in res/backgrounds/
# x and y position is specified as a tile (8x8 pixels) position.
# so, (5,6) would be 40,64 if it was specified in pixels
